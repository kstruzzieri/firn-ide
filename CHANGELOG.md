## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Golem now sizes its per-turn context budget from the configured model's
  declared context window instead of leaving go-llm's conservative 8192-token
  default in place. Under the old default a single repo question could evict its
  own file reads between steps, so the run re-read the same files until it hit
  the step cap and returned no answer at all. A declared window is treated as at
  most 32768 tokens, and a quarter of that is then reserved for the reply, so a
  model declaring a 256k window gets a 24576-token input budget and still has
  room to answer on a server started with `-c 32768`. A model that declares no
  window, or one too small to reserve reply room from, keeps go-llm's default.
- Ollama requests now allocate the same context window used for Golem's
  input budget. The optional budget probe applies Firn's protected-file policy
  and resolves reasoning settings from the selected model when overriding it.
- A workspace state file that fails to decode (a hand-edited type mismatch, a
  truncated file, or one written by a newer Firn) is no longer overwritten by
  a default session on the next save. Saving for that workspace is paused for
  the session and the file is left as it is; the first refused save shows a
  toast that stays until dismissed and names the workspace, the file, the
  reason and the remedy: fix or remove the file, then restart Firn, or open
  the workspace with the newer Firn that wrote it. An empty state file reads
  as absent. (#290)

## [0.12.0] - 2026-09-06

Feature release covering the Wails v3 host migration, the Golem configuration
and center-panel workspace, the completed 3-way merge resolution editor, run
execution identity Phase 2, and the Go 1.25 toolchain.

### Platform

- Raised the macOS support floor from 11 (Big Sur) to 12 (Monterey), matching
  the Wails v3 beta.16 deployment target (#273).
- The app now runs on the Wails v3 host (v3.0.0-beta.16), with the same
  features and window behavior as before (#273).
- Linux continues to target WebKit2GTK 4.1 (GTK3), with the build pinned to
  that ABI (#273).
- Host access is confined to an adapter module, and runtime events carry a
  single payload, so the framework seam is isolated from feature code (#273).
- The module and every CI job moved from Go 1.23 to Go 1.25, with each workflow
  reading `go-version-file: 'go.mod'` so the module is the single source of
  truth for future upgrades (#225).

### Golem

- A consent-gated workspace chat panel is available, running on the embedded
  `go-llm` runtime; no request leaves the machine before consent is granted
  (#226).
- Commit-message generation now uses that embedded runtime instead of shelling
  out to the Golem CLI (#165).
- A configuration workspace surfaces models, roles, profiles, and provider
  destinations as a complete projection with typed diagnostics, and applies
  edits through transactional writes that never leave settings half-written
  (#263).
- The Golem interface is a first-class center panel with a drag-arrangeable
  split, collapse rails, reordering, per-pane command bars, and layout that
  persists across restarts (#271).
- The panel can be undocked into a second native window. Exactly one window
  owns execution at a time, relayed events are acknowledged, and the mode and
  window bounds persist in an app-level `~/.firn/app.json` (#271).
- Phase routing and destination admission are consumed from `go-llm`:
  consent-derived destination policy, planning floors, and fallback-aware
  consent, so a fallback destination cannot silently widen the granted scope
  (#285).

### Git

- The 3-way merge resolution editor is complete: backend conflict data,
  a merge session store, the resolution MVP, a confidence layer that ranks
  regions, and a multi-file flow hardened against external changes (#164).
- Merge sessions preserve each side's trailing-newline state, so resolving a
  conflict no longer adds or drops a newline at end of file.
- Refusals during merge resolution now explain why the write was rejected
  instead of failing silently.
- Conflicted files collapse to a single Problems entry rather than flooding the
  panel with per-region diagnostics (#242).
- The status bar diagnostics summary is projected from the same conflict-aware
  source as the Problems panel, so the two can no longer disagree.
- Repository-local Git environment variables inherited from hooks are scrubbed
  before Firn runs Git, so operations in a linked worktree cannot corrupt the
  parent repository (#194).

### Run Profiles

- Run output is retained per execution instance, so a completed run keeps its
  own tab instead of being overwritten by the next one (#146 Phase 2A).
- A profile can run several instances concurrently, each with its own
  lifecycle and output (#146 Phase 2B).
- Run history persists across restarts with a bounded retention policy
  (#146 Phase 2C).
- Compound execution plans are owned and deep-copied at admission, so a plan
  cannot be mutated underneath a run in flight (#146 Phase 2D).
- A run ended by an administrative stop (quit or workspace switch) is now
  classified as stopped rather than failed.
- Run output listeners survive a collapsed bottom panel instead of detaching
  and losing subsequent output.
- The run profile card action row wraps, so the adopt button is no longer
  clipped at narrow widths.

### Search and Editor

- Search results are match-anchored, with a header hierarchy that stays
  readable in a narrow panel (#207).
- Match context uses dimmed syntax-token highlighting so the match itself
  remains the most prominent element (#215).
- Navigating to a result scrolls to the target line both when the file is
  freshly opened and when it is already open in a background tab.
- CodeMirror language support loads on demand instead of being pulled into the
  initial static JavaScript graph, which a manifest regression gate holds in
  place (#39).
- A broken `rust-analyzer` proxy is detected and bypassed rather than leaving
  language features silently dead.

### Workspace and File Tree

- A command palette opens the command registry with keyboard-first search
  (#44).
- Hybrid tree rails show active scope and per-file workspace ownership (#202).
- Editor tabs are colored by their owning workspace, with accent tokens
  validated through a shared helper (#142).
- Nested `.gitignore` rules are applied when walking the tree (#149).
- Directories that cannot be read are surfaced in the tree instead of appearing
  empty (#195).
- The loading skeleton shows during an uncached workspace fetch rather than
  being suppressed (#204).
- Docker, Terraform, and Compose-Spec files carry infra accents (#143), and
  `package.json` workspaces are classified as Frontend or Node (#253).
- The workspace accent palette was rebuilt to be brand-true (#257 phase 1).

### Accessibility

- WCAG AA conformance work landed across the interface with automated
  evidence; a human screen-reader pass remains prudent release validation
  (#43).
- Every button carries an explicit `type`, guarded by a test that also fails on
  a vacuous scan (#34).

### Security

- On Windows, the no-follow open behind Firn's bounded reads now refuses
  symlinks and junctions, matching the link refusal Unix already had. The check
  rejects name-surrogate reparse points specifically rather than every reparse
  point. This covers the bounded read paths, including run-history loading;
  ordinary editor reads and writes are unchanged.

### Build and CI

- Required checks report on stacked pull requests, and PR path filters were
  dropped so a required check can never be skipped into a permanently pending
  state (#267).
- Scoped Go tests are Windows-portable, and the compound run-profile tests were
  deflaked by gating on the final snapshot.

### Known limitations

- Undocking the Golem panel was smoke-tested on macOS only; the Windows and
  Linux rows of the #271 verification checklist are untested.
- On Linux, focus after restoring an undocked window follows the window
  manager rather than Firn.
- Golem conversations are held in a bounded in-memory store: 2 MiB per
  conversation snapshot and 16 MiB across all of them. A conversation that
  outgrows the per-snapshot bound stops persisting rather than being evicted,
  and nothing survives process exit. Durable, user-managed multi-conversation
  storage is tracked in #264.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-07-12

Stabilization release for the managed language-server, Structure view, Git,
terminal, and installation work completed since v0.10.0.

### Language Intelligence

- Managed provisioning now covers pinned, checksum-verified Python, Go,
  TypeScript/JavaScript, and Rust language servers without modifying the
  user's project or global PATH (#112, #151).
- Python analysis now wires detected project environments and rooted import
  paths correctly, preserves project metadata across interpreter overrides,
  rejects stale overrides, and restores automatic detection on reset (#112).
- Provisioning retry, nested-project roots, Alpine/musl Node fallbacks, Rust
  document sync, and actionable offline recovery were hardened and verified in
  the packaged native closure pass for #112.
- A Structure view exposes document symbols for the active file with refresh,
  filtering, keyboard navigation, and click-to-reveal (#168).

### Git

- Stage or unstage individual hunks from the editor gutter and diff views, with
  zero-context patches so nearby edits remain independent (#163).
- Intent-to-add support makes untracked files diffable and hunk-stageable
  without staging their contents (#167).
- The working-tree side of unstaged diffs is editable in place, with save
  ordering and hunk anchors hardened against stale refreshes and accidental
  cross-hunk edits (#169).

### Terminal

- Terminal sessions now start only on explicit request, open in the loaded
  workspace root, and recover the prompt reliably after command completion
  instead of leaving xterm input wedged.

### Installation

- Added a macOS/Linux install script with latest-release resolution, explicit
  version pinning, dry-run output, SHA-256 verification, and platform-aware
  installation targets.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-07-08

Milestone 7: Git integration. Firn now surfaces working-tree status, diffs,
staging, commit, and branch operations directly in the workspace, and the LSP
hover was reworked to highlight and link like a full editor.

### Git
- Working-tree status in the file tree (modified / added / deleted / untracked
  colors via `--git-*` tokens) and the current branch in the status bar (#26).
- Branch switcher shared between an always-visible header pill and the status
  bar, portaled to `document.body` so it is never clipped by panel stacking.
- Diff viewer: read-only side-by-side view with next/previous change navigation
  (`F7` / `Shift+F7`), resizable columns, Open File, and a live diff against the
  open editor buffer that refreshes as you type.
- Commit panel: per-file and section include checkboxes, collapse chevrons,
  filename colors by git state, stage/commit, pull/push with Publish when there
  is no upstream, a commit receipt, and workspace-scoped ownership.
- Gutter change bars with a peek popup showing a unified word-level inline diff
  (unchanged text plain, removals struck red, additions green) and one-click
  revert-to-HEAD; the popup dismisses on an editor click, an edit, or a revert.
- A `core.bare=true` repository now shows an actionable message instead of
  "not a git repository" (#27).

### Editor
- LSP hover signatures are highlighted with the file's real language parser, so
  Go and every other supported language colorize instead of falling back to a
  flat single color; documentation references render as clickable links that
  open externally.
- The hover tooltip shrink-wraps to its content and collapses padded blank
  lines, removing the empty space around short hovers.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-01

First public preview. Firn is a lightweight, workspace-focused IDE for macOS,
Linux, and Windows built with Wails (Go + React/Vite), using the system webview
for a small (~15MB) binary. This release consolidates the editor, workspace,
run-profile, terminal, language-server, and search work completed to date.

Requires macOS 11 (Big Sur) or later, a Linux distribution with WebKit2GTK 4.1,
or Windows 10/11 (WebView2).

### Editor
- CodeMirror 6 editor with multi-tab editing and per-tab state.
- Per-file undo history and view state (cursor, scroll) preserved across tab
  switches; external file reloads reconcile without clobbering history (#153).
- Syntax theme system: multiple palettes with live switching, a Python syntax
  overlay, and a status-bar theme picker (#113, #114, #117, #119).
- In-file find and replace (#25).

### Workspaces
- One repository can host multiple focused workspaces (e.g. `frontend/`,
  `backend/go/`), each with independent layout, run profiles, and language
  services scope.
- Workspace identity and accent colors; Workspace and Project file-tree views
  with per-region tinting (#53, #54).
- Session persistence of layout, open files, expanded paths, and active
  workspace across restarts and project switches.

### File Explorer
- Virtualized file tree for large repositories (#37, #111).
- Lazy directory loading: directory contents are read on expand, decoupling I/O
  cost from tree size, with surgical watcher reconciliation (#37, #147).

### Run Profiles
- First-class run configurations with auto-detection from `package.json`,
  `go.mod`, `pyproject.toml`, `Makefile`, and `docker-compose`.
- Workspace-owned detection and identity; per-workspace `.firn` persistence.
- Process execution with full lifecycle management (start, stop, restart,
  SIGTERM grace period) and compound (multi-step) execution (#63).
- Formalized run execution identity for parallel and compound runs (#103).
- Working-set panel with adoption, pinning, and run-recency; header run-target
  selector with `Cmd/Ctrl+R`; create/edit form with workspace assignment
  (#18, #71, #132).
- Run output views: merged, per-stream lanes (independent scroll), diff, and
  timeline; predicted-completion ETA and status badges (#107, #137).

### Terminal
- xterm.js terminal backed by a PTY, with OSC 133 shell integration for command
  markers and exit-status separators (zsh and bash) (#47).

### Language Servers
- Language server integration with per-project root resolution
  (#20, #75, #76).
- Python environment auto-wiring (interpreter, venv, extra paths) with zero
  per-project config (#112).
- Managed language-server provisioning with pinned, checksum-verified downloads
  and an interpreter picker (#112).

### Search
- Project-wide search powered by ripgrep with grouped results (#23).

### Fixed
- File tree no longer shows the wrong project's contents after switching
  projects (cross-workspace `treeSnapshot` contamination) (#156).
- Active workspace tab underline no longer strikes through the tab name on the
  first render after toggling to Workspace view (#157).
- Run-profile cards expand on click even before their first run, exposing Edit /
  Pin / Hide; a user profile's workspace can be reassigned from the edit form;
  command and output text wraps instead of truncating (#158).

### Infrastructure
- Wails v2 (Go 1.23+ backend, React 19 + TypeScript + Vite frontend).
- CI for tests, linting, and cross-platform builds; Husky pre-commit and
  pre-push hooks; golangci-lint v2.11.4; frontend and backend coverage.
- macOS dev-build fix for the UniformTypeIdentifiers framework (#145).
