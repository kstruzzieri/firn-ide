# Firn IDE — Roadmap

> A lightweight, workspace-focused desktop IDE for macOS, Linux, and Windows.
> Built with [Wails](https://wails.io) (Go backend + system WebView + React frontend).

## Vision

Firn IDE brings the focused, keyboard-first productivity of JetBrains IDEs to a lightweight, open-source package. Instead of loading an entire monorepo into one IDE instance, Firn lets you define **multiple workspaces** within a single repository — each with its own layout state, language servers, and run profiles.

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Workspace-first design** — One repo, multiple focused workspaces (frontend, backend, infra)
- **Lightweight binary** — ~15MB via Wails (vs ~150MB+ for Electron apps)
- **JetBrains-inspired UX** — Dockable tool windows, keyboard-first, search everywhere
- **Run Profiles** — First-class build/lint/test/deploy configurations per workspace
- **Firn Glacier theme** — Blue-tinted gradient dark theme with workspace-specific accent colors

## Current Repository Review and Prioritized Roadmap

This section supersedes the archived delivery narrative below for current prioritization.

### Repository health

- `v0.11.0` is live from `main` at `4707c59`. The release workflow, Build, Tests, and Lint passed; macOS amd64/arm64, Linux amd64, Windows amd64, and `SHA256SUMS` are published.
- No planned stabilization sprint follows the release. Cut `v0.11.1` only for observed regressions; otherwise continue the parallel product tracks below.
- #39 removed the eager all-language chunk: initial static JavaScript fell from **541,248 gzip bytes to 399,225 gzip bytes** (26.24%) with a manifest regression gate.
- Git, LSP, search, commands, and merge-session state already have dedicated seams. Do not run #41 as a big-bang refactor; extract only the run domain if #146 directly needs it.
- Release documentation and install examples now target `v0.11.0`.
- PR #228 raised the module to **Go 1.25** and switched every workflow from a repeated `go-version` literal to `go-version-file: 'go.mod'`, so the module is the single source of truth for future upgrades. The pinned `golangci-lint` v2.11.4 is built with go1.26.1 and therefore analyzes a 1.25 module without complaint. Workflow Wails installs remain pinned to the module's v2.11.0; cross-platform PR verification remains a future release-engineering improvement.
- #194 removed the linked-worktree Git-environment safety gate; new worktrees may branch from current `develop` after verifying a clean baseline.
- The merge-resolution MVP (#164 Phase 2) generated its own follow-up backlog — #219-#223 — and the Phase 3 confidence layer added #240-#242, rather than any observed regression. Treat those as scoped enhancements, not defects.

### Latest delivery wave

Six recent implementation tracks landed:

1. **#44 — implemented via PR #206:** the native-dialog command palette, deterministic fuzzy matcher, late-bound command registry, and shared shortcuts shipped. The GitHub issue remains open because the PR used `Addresses #44`; close it after tracker housekeeping.
2. **#164 — shipped in full and closed, phases 0-3 via PRs #208/#209/#213/#239 and phase 4 via PR #244:** backend conflict snapshots, the guarded merge-session store, the CodeMirror Result-spine merge editor, the confidence layer (preview, word marks, provenance stripes, targeted reopen, base display, line numbers, announcements), and multi-file hardening. What remains is the follow-up backlog, not the issue itself.
3. **#202 — closed via PR #211:** Workspace view now carries two distinct rails for active scope and per-file ownership without adding a third visual channel or changing Project view.
4. **#207 / #215 — closed via PRs #214/#217:** search results gained match-anchored rows and file/directory hierarchy, then dimmed syntax-token highlighting that keeps the match the brightest element in the row.
5. **#216 / #218 — editor navigation fixes:** navigating to a line now scrolls correctly both for a freshly opened file and for an already-open background tab.
6. **#146 Phase 2 (complete, issue closed):** Phase 2A merged via PR #224, Phase 2B same-profile parallelism via PR #232, Phase 2C persisted run history via PR #233, and Phase 2D owned compound execution plans via PR #237. `internal/runhistory` retains 50 summaries and 5 rich ordinary records per profile, with 10 MiB per-record and 20 MiB per-workspace bounds. Terminal events enqueue persistence; close gives appends a best-effort 300 ms drain, waits durably for explicit redactions, and still withholds acknowledgement when editor flush fails. Phase 2D landed an `executionNode` tree deep-copied at admission behind a recursive reflection guard, and the two bugs it surfaced are fixed: the run-output listener unmounting on panel collapse (#235 via PR #245) and compound drains misclassifying an administratively cancelled preflight as failed (#236 via PR #238).

PR #227 additionally fixed a clipped adopt button in the run-profile card action row.

### Parallel development plan

#### Current wave — three isolated worktrees

| Lane | Ticket | Primary ownership | Dependency and conflict rule |
|------|--------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| A | Golem follow-ups — #263 settings UI, #264 durable multi-conversation, #265 token/context usage | `internal/ai`, `frontend/src/components/Golem`, `golemStore` | #165 and #226 are both shipped: the embedded `go-llm` runtime replaced the commit-message shell-out, and PR #262 landed the chat panel on it. #265 is blocked on go-llm emitting usage; go-llm #393 (sanitized tool args on `tool.started`/`tool.finished`) would fill in the tool-chip detail view. #263 Phase 1 (read-only projection, diagnostics, panel view) has no upstream dependency and is implemented on `feature/issue-263-golem-settings-phase1`; the #263 write phases (role/provider edits, key entry) depend on go-llm #410 (source-preserving models.json document API). |
| B | #164 merge follow-up backlog — #220, #219, #221, #223, #240, #241 | `frontend/src/components/Editor/Merge*`, merge-specific `GitPanel` seams, `gitStore` merge tests | #164 itself is closed: phase 4 shipped via PR #244, and #222 and #242 are closed. What remains is the follow-up backlog above. Do not start #166 or #46 against the same editor/Git seams. |
| C | #45 — context menus | `FileExplorer` row/context surfaces, editor tab-bar menus, command registry entries | Unblocked: #202 released the File Explorer seams. Reuse #44's registry instead of adding a parallel action path. Keep out of the merge editor while Lane B is active. |

#### Follow-on queue

1. Work the #164 merge follow-up backlog in Lane B — #220 auto-merged region hints, #219 key-hold preview, #221 multi-file conflict rail, #223 bulk take-Current/Incoming, #240 pre-stage diagnostics check, #241 base-relative word marks. #164 phase 4 shipped via PR #244; #222 newline metadata and #242 collapsed conflicted-file diagnostics are closed.
2. Start #166 only after the merge surface stabilizes. Split it into safe/read-only branch metadata and later destructive merge/rebase/rename/delete operations.
3. Start #46 after the #164 editor surface stabilizes; keep sibling navigation compatible with lazy directory loading.
4. Work the Golem follow-ups in Lane A now that #226 has shipped: #263 settings UI Phase 1 first (read-only; write phases gated on go-llm #410), then #264 durable multi-conversation; hold #265 until go-llm emits usage.
5. Close the #44 tracker as housekeeping; the implementation shipped in PR #206.
6. Keep #148/#196 benchmark-gated and #41 unscheduled as a standalone rewrite.

### Ticket priority and disposition

| Priority | Ticket | Recommended disposition |
|----------|--------|-------------------------|
| Closed | #42 Hardcoded macOS paths | Closed as completed on 2026-07-11; retain release smoke coverage. |
| Closed | #112 LSP zero-config | Packaged native closure gate passed on 2026-07-12; final fixes merged in PR #183 and the issue is closed as completed. |
| Closed | #34 Button types | Closed via PR #190 on 2026-07-13; explicit literal types on all production buttons plus an AST regression guard. |
| Closed | #149 Nested `.gitignore` | Closed via PR #192 on 2026-07-14; recursive and shallow readers share nested Git-compatible rule evaluation. |
| Closed | #142 Workspace-colored tabs | Closed via PR #191 on 2026-07-13; tabs resolve the owning workspace independently of the active workspace. |
| Closed | #194 Git environment isolation | Closed via PR #197 on 2026-07-14; linked-worktree Git commands scrub repository-local environment. |
| Closed | #43 WCAG AA | Closed via PR #201 on 2026-07-15; automated contrast, keyboard, focus, and ID-reference evidence landed. |
| Closed | #39 Dynamic languages | Closed after PR #200; lazy CodeMirror loading cut initial static-JS gzip size by 26.24% and added a bundle gate. |
| Closed | #143 Infra file accents | Closed after PR #199; Docker/Terraform identity now layers over workspace presentation. |
| Closed | #195 Unreadable directories | Closed via PR #203; unreadable nodes remain visible and retry in place. |
| Closed | #204 Loading skeleton | Closed via PR #205; uncached workspace loading no longer flashes a false empty state. |
| Closed | #202 Hybrid workspace rails | Closed via PR #211; the two-rail Workspace view ships without changing Project view or adding a third visual channel. |
| Closed | #207 Search result hierarchy | Closed via PR #214; match-anchored rows and file/directory hierarchy stay readable in a narrow panel. |
| Closed | #215 Dimmed syntax tokens | Closed via PR #217; match context carries dimmed language tokens while the match stays the brightest element. |
| Closed | Editor nav scroll (PRs #216/#218) | Fixed directly in PRs #216/#218; line navigation scrolls correctly for freshly opened and already-open background tabs. |
| Delivered / tracker open | #44 Command Palette | PR #206 satisfies the issue requirements; verify and close the tracker without more implementation. |
| Closed | #225 Go 1.25 toolchain | Module and every CI job resolve Go from `go-version-file: 'go.mod'`; shipped via PR #228. |
| Closed | #164 Phase 3 merge confidence | Shipped via PR #239: preview, word marks, provenance stripes, targeted reopen, base display, line numbers, announcements. |
| P0 | #164 Phase 4 multi-file hardening | Queue auto-advance (still suppressed in the UI) plus the watcher/external-change policy. The atomic single-snapshot swap is the risk: never apply a regions-only refetch to stale content. |
| P1 | #45 Context menus | Reuse #44 commands now that #202 has released the File Explorer seams. |
| P2 | #46 Breadcrumbs | Build on shared navigation commands and the lazy tree-loading contract after the merge editor stabilizes. |
| P2 | #220 Auto-merged region hints | Indicate what Git already merged so reviewers can distinguish it from unresolved regions. |
| P2 | #219 Key-hold resolution preview | Preview a side without committing the decision; must not mutate the Result document. |
| P2 | #221 Multi-file conflict rail | Extend the conflict rail across files in the Git panel; keep per-file finalize guards intact. |
| P2 | #222 Newline metadata | Preserve per-side no-trailing-newline metadata through resolution and write. |
| P2 | #223 Bulk conflict resolution | Add confirmed take-all-Current/Incoming actions; never silently overwrite manual decisions, never auto-write or stage. |
| P2 | #240 Pre-stage diagnostics check | Once the buffer is marker-free, report whether the resolution compiles before it is staged. Needs a document handoff, not a refcounted lease. |
| P2 | #241 Base-relative word marks | When git recorded a base, mark each side against it to show what that side changed rather than how the sides differ. |
| P2 | #242 Conflicted-file diagnostics | Collapse per-marker errors into one actionable warning keyed on git's `UU` status; must clear the moment the file is written clean. |
| P2 | #166 Rich VCS menu | Start after #164; separate safe/read-only behavior from destructive branch operations. |
| P2 | #263 Golem settings UI | Models, roles, and keys from the panel; project keys write-only so a stored secret never reads back. |
| P2 | #264 Golem durable multi-conversation | Persist and switch between conversations; the New chat reset shipped with #226 is the in-memory slice of this. |
| P3 | #265 Golem token and context usage | Blocked: needs go-llm to emit usage on its run events first. |
| Incremental | #41 Zustand slices | Extract only domains required by active feature work; do not schedule a standalone rewrite. |
| Gated | #148 Lazy watcher registration | Benchmark first; implementation has meaningful lifecycle/race risk. |
| Gated | #196 Ignore-rule cache | Benchmark lazy expansion first; if needed, cache per directory with watcher-based invalidation, never polling. |

### #112 manual smoke pass and closure gate

The automated coverage is already strong; this smoke pass verifies the user-visible seams that unit tests cannot fully prove. Run it against the current `develop` build using a disposable Firn home so the test does not touch real Firn settings or managed-server caches.

#### 2026-07-12 packaged native rerun: PASS — #112 closure gate satisfied

The packaged macOS arm64 app was exercised from disposable root `/private/tmp/firn-112-gate.qiqBFG` with user-installed language servers excluded from the launch `PATH`.

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Clean-cache lazy provisioning | **Pass** | Python `1.39.9`, gopls `v0.22.0`, TypeScript `5.3.0`, and rust-analyzer `2026-07-06` appeared under the disposable Firn cache only after their files were opened, one family at a time. The rerun exposed a missing frontend `.rs` mapping; a failing regression was added before the one-line fix, after which the packaged Rust path provisioned and reached ready. |
| Python environment wiring | **Pass** | `structlog`, `src/smoke_pkg`, and `datetime.UTC` resolved with the detected Python 3.11.14 `.venv`. The Problems panel contained only the deliberate `Literal[42]`-to-`str` diagnostic; no import diagnostic or raw setup toast appeared. |
| Interpreter override/reset | **Pass** | The native picker selected `/private/tmp/firn-112-gate.qiqBFG/manual-venv/bin/python3`, the setup card identified the manual interpreter, imports remained resolved, and **Reset to auto** restored the project `.venv` and cleared the persisted override. |
| Offline and same-session Retry | **Pass** | A second empty Firn cache and isolated empty installer cache ran behind a deliberately unavailable process-scoped proxy. Firn stayed usable and rendered `Could not download the language server (offline)` with **Retry**. Bringing the proxy online and clicking Retry in the same app session installed basedpyright and restored the single deliberate diagnostic. |
| Scope and host hygiene | **Pass** | Managed artifacts remained under the disposable Firn homes; the host language-server paths and global `PATH` were unchanged. Wi-Fi and all smoke processes were restored/stopped after the run. |

All close criteria below are satisfied. The fix/evidence PR #183 merged at `b0445c9`, and #112 is closed as completed.

#### 2026-07-12 defect-fix rerun: AUTOMATED PASS; native gate still pending (historical)

The fix was exercised on macOS arm64 with disposable root `/private/tmp/firn-112-smoke.I3boO5`. The temporary real-server Go harness was removed after the run. These fixes later merged in PR #183 and are included in the completed closure state above.

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| TDD regressions | **Pass** | The initial focused run failed in the intended four places: whole-section and leaf-section configuration still returned `[src]`, while override mode lost detected metadata in both provider and emitted status. Review then exposed stale missing-interpreter diagnostics and unvalidated persisted overrides; focused regressions failed with `misconfigured_env` and an accepted deleted interpreter before their fixes. Reset-to-auto now returns to ordinary detection. |
| LSP and repository Go verification | **Pass** | `go test ./internal/lsp/... -count=1`: **214 tests passed** across 3 packages. `go test ./... -count=1`: **655 tests passed** across 12 packages. `go vet ./...`: no issues. |
| Real basedpyright 1.39.9, detected environment | **Pass** | A Python **3.11.14** `.venv` contained a normal `six==1.17.0` site-packages install; the workspace also contained `src/smoke_pkg`, `datetime.UTC`, and one deliberate line-8 assignment error. Basedpyright requested `python`, `basedpyright.analysis`, and `basedpyright`; its only diagnostic was `Literal[42]` not assignable to `str`. No site-packages, `src`, or stdlib import diagnostic appeared. |
| Real basedpyright 1.39.9, manual override | **Pass** | Repeating the same stdio session setup with the manual override pointed at the fixture `.venv/bin/python` retained detected venv and rooted `extraPaths`; the unit regression also covers preservation of detected Python-version metadata. The same three configuration sections were requested and the deliberate line-8 type error remained the only diagnostic. |
| Explicit project configuration semantics | **Pass** | The detector remains unchanged: existing `pyrightconfig.json` or `[tool.pyright] extraPaths` declarations suppress Firn's `src` injection. Only detector-delivered relative paths are rooted at the LSP configuration boundary; already-absolute paths remain absolute. Existing detector/config-provider coverage passed in the complete suite. |
| Packaged build | **Pass** | Wails 2.11.0 production build completed and produced `build/bin/Firn.app/Contents/MacOS/firn`. Generated-binding content remained unchanged. |
| Native lazy-family and Offline-to-Retry gate | **Not observed** | The packaged app launched with fresh home `/private/tmp/firn-112-native.HWdWfR`; `.firn/servers` was absent before launch. macOS returned `osascript is not allowed assistive access` and displayed the Accessibility permission dialog over Firn. Screen capture worked, but interaction was blocked, so no claim is made for one-family-at-a-time provisioning or same-session Offline-to-Retry recovery. |

At this interim checkpoint, required follow-up items 1–3 below were complete and item 4 remained the closure blocker. The later packaged native rerun passed item 4, PR #183 merged, and #112 closed as completed.

#### 2026-07-11 execution result: FAILED (historical; superseded by closure pass)

Smoke root: `/private/tmp/firn-lsp-smoke.XCPypG` on macOS arm64, using a fresh packaged `develop` build and disposable homes/caches. Temporary harness files were removed after the run; only this evidence remains in the repository.

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Packaged build | **Pass** | `wails build` completed and produced `build/bin/Firn.app/Contents/MacOS/firn`. |
| Fresh real managed installs | **Pass** | Pinned basedpyright `1.39.9`, gopls `v0.22.0`, typescript-language-server `5.3.0`, and rust-analyzer `2026-07-06` downloaded, verified/extracted, committed to a fresh cache, resolved from `launch.json`, and each stayed alive over stdio during a launch probe. |
| Python 3.11 interpreter + site-packages | **Pass** | Firn detected the fixture `.venv/bin/python`; a normally installed site-packages module resolved. `datetime.UTC` produced no compatibility diagnostic. Editable installs that rely on executable `.pth` import hooks are not a valid static-analysis fixture, so the final pass used a normal wheel install. |
| Python `src` layout | **Fail — product blocker** | The detector returned `extraPaths: ["src"]`; basedpyright requested `python`, `basedpyright.analysis`, and `basedpyright` configuration and received that value, but still published `Import "smoke_pkg" could not be resolved`. A smoke-only absolute value (`<projectRoot>/src`) immediately cleared the import error while retaining the deliberate type-error diagnostic. Production must resolve injected paths against the project root before returning LSP configuration. |
| Manual interpreter override | **Fail — product blocker** | Selecting the same valid `.venv` interpreter changed `ConfigSource` to `override`, but `PythonEnv` replaced the detected environment with an interpreter-only object. `VenvDir`, `ExtraPaths`, and `PythonVersion` were lost (`extraPaths=[]`), so override mode can regress the same imports it is intended to repair. Overlay the override path/source onto detected metadata instead of returning early with a partial environment. |
| Offline/retry plumbing | **Automated pass; native manual check pending** | Six focused Go tests passed for offline classification, retry root routing, and override plumbing; all 18 `LSPSetupCard` tests passed, including Retry invocation and error handling. A real native offline toggle/retry was not observed. |
| Native setup-card/lazy-family UI | **Not observed** | The isolated Firn process launched, but macOS withheld both the Accessibility tree and screen capture from the automation host. No visual claim is made. Rerun this portion after granting the host Accessibility and Screen Recording permissions, or perform it manually. |

Historical #112 follow-up checklist (now complete), in execution order:

1. Convert detector-generated relative extra paths to project-root-resolved absolute paths at the LSP configuration boundary; retain explicit project config semantics.
2. Make interpreter overrides enrich/overlay the detected environment so venv, `src`, and Python-version metadata survive.
3. Add regressions for absolute `workspace/configuration` values and override metadata retention, plus a real basedpyright integration smoke that proves site-packages, `src` imports, Python 3.11 stdlib, and a deliberate diagnostic together.
4. Rerun the full packaged native pass, including lazy one-family-at-a-time provisioning and an offline-to-Retry recovery in the same app session. Close #112 only when every row above passes.

#### 1. Prepare a clean launch environment

Build the current `develop` revision normally, then launch the packaged binary with a disposable home and a minimal tool shim. Building first avoids making the Go/npm build caches part of the smoke environment. The shim keeps the Go toolchain available for managed `gopls` installation while excluding user-installed `gopls`, `typescript-language-server`, `rust-analyzer`, and Python language servers from `PATH`.

```bash
wails build
SMOKE_HOME="$(mktemp -d)"
SMOKE_BIN="$SMOKE_HOME/bin"
mkdir -p "$SMOKE_BIN"
ln -s "$(command -v go)" "$SMOKE_BIN/go"
env HOME="$SMOKE_HOME" \
  PATH="$SMOKE_BIN:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin" \
  build/bin/Firn.app/Contents/MacOS/firn
```

The final path is the macOS build. Use `build/bin/firn` for Linux; on Windows, launch `build/bin/firn.exe` under a disposable user profile with the equivalent restricted `PATH`. Before opening a file, confirm `$SMOKE_HOME/.firn/servers` is absent or empty. If a platform needs another runtime tool, add only that executable to `SMOKE_BIN`; do not add an entire directory containing language-server binaries.

#### 2. Use a four-workspace smoke repository

Prepare a disposable repository with:

- Python: `pyproject.toml`, Python 3.11+ `.venv`, `src/smoke_pkg/__init__.py`, and `src/main.py`; install one third-party package such as `structlog` into the venv.
- Go: `go.mod` and `main.go`.
- TypeScript: `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and `src/index.ts`.
- Rust: `Cargo.toml` and `src/main.rs`.

In `src/main.py`, import all three cases from #112:

```python
import structlog
from datetime import UTC
from smoke_pkg import VALUE
```

The file must be clean without `pyrightconfig.json` or Firn-specific configuration.

#### 3. Verify lazy managed provisioning

1. Open only the Python workspace and `src/main.py`.
2. Confirm the setup card reports provisioning without a raw error toast, then clears or reports ready.
3. Confirm only the Python family appears under `$SMOKE_HOME/.firn/servers`; Go, TypeScript, and Rust must not provision before their workspaces become active.
4. Open one file in each remaining workspace, one family at a time. Confirm each transitions through managed provisioning to ready and creates only its own pinned cache directory.
5. Confirm `command -v basedpyright-langserver`, `command -v gopls`, `command -v typescript-language-server`, and `command -v rust-analyzer` remain unchanged outside the smoke process. Firn must not mutate the global `PATH` or install into a global tool directory.

#### 4. Verify Python environment wiring

- `structlog` resolves from `.venv` site-packages.
- `smoke_pkg` resolves through the detected `src` layout.
- `datetime.UTC` resolves under the detected Python 3.11+ interpreter.
- Add a deliberate type error and confirm a diagnostic appears; remove it and confirm the diagnostic clears.
- If a project `pyrightconfig.json` or `[tool.pyright]` is added, confirm Firn honors it rather than overriding it.

#### 5. Verify actionable failure and retry

1. Use a second fresh smoke home, disconnect networking, and open a supported file that requires provisioning.
2. Confirm Firn remains usable and shows an actionable non-blocking Offline/Failed card with **Retry**, not a bare server-not-found error or blocking dialog.
3. Reconnect networking and click **Retry** without changing projects.
4. Confirm provisioning completes and language features become active.

#### 6. Verify interpreter override polish

- Exercise **Select interpreter** with a valid alternate Python interpreter.
- Confirm the setup UI identifies the manual override.
- Click **Reset to auto** and confirm Firn returns to the detected project interpreter.
- In a nested monorepo Python project, trigger **Retry** and confirm the server starts at the nested project root, not the repository root.

#### 7. Closure criteria (all satisfied; #112 closed)

The criteria used to close #112 were recorded in the final issue evidence:

- [x] Clean-cache managed provisioning succeeds without a system/project server.
- [x] Python third-party, first-party `src`, and Python-version imports resolve with zero Firn config.
- [x] Missing network/server produces a non-blocking actionable card and Retry recovers.
- [x] Provisioning is lazy by active workspace and writes only under the Firn-managed cache.
- [x] Python, Go, TypeScript, and Rust each reach a usable ready state.
- [x] Interpreter override, Reset to auto, and nested-project Retry behave correctly.
- [x] No raw setup error toast, global install, or global `PATH` mutation occurs.

One primary-platform manual pass is sufficient for closure when the cross-platform catalog/provisioner tests and release build matrix remain green. Repeat the smoke on another OS only if the primary pass exposes platform-specific behavior.

## Delivery History (Archived)

> The narrative below preserves implementation context from earlier roadmap snapshots. Its references to "open" or "remaining" work are historical; the authoritative backlog and priorities are in the section above.

Current status: **Milestone 7 (Git Integration) is complete and merged (PR #162, develop `eb43370`) — every planned milestone is now shipped.** Working-tree status in the file tree and status bar; a read-only side-by-side diff viewer with next/prev navigation, resizable columns, and a live editor-buffer diff; JetBrains-style commit panel with per-file include checkboxes, stage/commit/pull/push (Publish when there is no upstream), and workspace scoping via the ownership model; a portaled branch switcher shared between the header pill and the status bar; and gutter change bars with a peek popup showing a unified word-level inline diff and one-click revert-to-HEAD. The LSP hover was also reworked to highlight signatures with the file's real language parser (Go and all languages) and render doc links as clickable. **#163** hunk-level staging shipped (PR #173, hardened via review PR #174/#176) and **#167** intent-to-add (`git add -N`, track-without-staging on untracked rows so new files diff and hunk-stage) shipped via PR #177; on the LSP side **#151** Phase 3 managed provisioning for `gopls`, `tsserver`, and `rust-analyzer` shipped via PR #178 (Python landed in #150). **#165** go-llm library integration shipped, replacing the golem CLI shell-out with the embedded runtime. **#164** 3-way merge UI, **#169** editable diff, #152 (LSP provisioning polish), #149 (nested gitignore), #146 (run-identity Phase 2), #142 (workspace-colored tabs), and #168 (Structure view from document symbols) have all since shipped and closed. Open Git follow-ups: **#166** richer branch/VCS menu plus the #164 merge backlog (#219, #220, #221, #223, #240, #241). Other open follow-ups: #148/#196, both benchmark-gated.

Earlier: **Milestone 4 (Run Profiles) closed — #103 run execution identity merged via PR #144.** The overloaded `profileId` string (which carried saved-config, compound-aggregate, compound-step, process-key, and event-routing meanings) is replaced by a first-class `RunIdentity{runInstanceId, profileId, parentRunInstanceId?, stepIdx}` embedded in every run event. The executor keys processes/compounds by a per-`Executor` monotonic `runInstanceId` and tracks `activeByProfile` (retiring the old `processAliases`); the synthetic `compound:<base64>:<idx>` step keys and their reserved-namespace validation are deleted; the frontend stores route output by explicit fields with a `runInstanceId`-based stale-drop/rotate rule (no namespace parsing). Documented Stop/Restart/Status semantics: an idle/unknown id is an idempotent no-op, terminal status is retained only for top-level runs. Phase 1 only — **Phase 2** (single-profile output/tabs/history re-keyed to `runInstanceId`, per-run retained tabs, same-profile parallelism, persisted run history) is a separate follow-up ticket. With the #18/#71 UI epic and LANES (#107/#137) already shipped, **Milestone 4 is complete**.

Earlier: **Milestone 2 closed — #47 Terminal shell integration (OSC 133 error markers + command separators) shipped**: embedded zsh/bash wrapper scripts inject `precmd`/`preexec` hooks (fail-open to a plain shell), an xterm OSC 133 state machine renders red/neutral gutter markers + block separators, atomic wrapper writes for concurrent-creation safety, with PTY-gated emission tests. Also **Milestone 4 #18 Run Profiles UI complete — P4 create/edit form shipped via PR #132**, with a UI/UX polish follow-up (PR #133) and a store persist-failure rollback fix (PR #134). This closes the #18/#71 Run Profiles UI epic. The form is a panel-takeover create / edit / **customize** / delete surface for single profiles: a "Start from" detected-command picker, name + command, working directory (native folder picker, relativized to the repo root), inline `KEY=value` env rows with a duplicate-key guard, an env file, and round-tripped env variants. It is the first consumer of `SaveRunProfile` / `DeleteRunProfile` / `ValidateRunProfile`, which now **emit `runprofiles:changed` on success** so the list refreshes with backend-normalized fields (no optimistic store mutation). **Copy-on-write identity:** editing a detected profile reuses its id so the detected twin is suppressed via `combineUnitLocked` — no duplicate. PR #133 retuned the card color scheme to the workspace-accent palette (a deep-navy `--surface-base` card surface matching the bottom output panel, accent-tinted hover / selected / failed / running states, a filled Cmd+R-target dot + full-card highlight, click-anywhere-to-target) and fixed the header run/stop button rendering as a blank, off-center square (the icon components had no intrinsic size). PR #134 makes `Store.Save` / `Store.Delete` roll back their in-memory mutation when the disk write fails, so memory and disk can't diverge (the emit path made that observable). Remaining Run Profiles work: **#103** (compound execution identity hardening) — the LANES output work (#107 via PR #138, #137 via PR #139) is now shipped.

Earlier: **Milestone 4 #71 P2 closed — review follow-ups + recency sidecar shipped via PR #127** (on top of the P2 panel, PR #125). #127 closes the three open P2 review follow-ups: a nil-`executor` guard in `StartRunProfile` (mirrors `StopRunProfile`); **run recency split into the `.firn/run-recency.json` sidecar**, separate from `run-profiles.json` (now profile definitions + adoption only), so stamping a run writes the tiny sidecar *synchronously* and never rewrites profile definitions — fixing per-run write amplification at the root with no debounce timer (and therefore no orphaned-write race, no lost-on-SIGKILL window, and write errors surfaced to the caller); legacy v3 files that embedded recency migrate into the sidecar on load; and `Store.PruneState` drops stale recency-only `profileState` entries on load (saved+detected IDs valid) while preserving `adopted` entries through branch churn. Also a repo-hygiene commit: a `trimws` git clean filter + `.gitattributes` kills the perpetual trailing-whitespace churn Wails emits into `wailsjs/go/*.ts` on every build.

The **P2 panel (PR #125)** is a four-section working set (Working Set / Pinned / RECENT / Detected) driven by a pure `groupProfiles` selector, with per-workspace adoption persisted in `.firn/run-profiles.json` **v3** and run recency in the `.firn/run-recency.json` sidecar, a `RunProfilesSnapshot{profiles, profileState}` single hydration contract emitted on every `runprofiles:changed`, Workspace/Project views (reusing the tree-view toggle, single source of truth), view-scoped `● N running · M total` counters, and a 5-min-windowed workspace-accent "just-ran" highlight. New app bindings `AdoptRunProfile`/`UnadoptRunProfile`/`GetRunProfilesSnapshot`. Earlier: **Phase 1 (workspace-owned detection + identity) shipped via #123** — repo-scoped `ProjectRunProfileManager`, owning-workspace identity + workspace-scoped IDs, per-workspace store with v1→v2 migration, owner-routed save/pin/delete, plus detector hardening (language markers beat infra; infra split Docker/Terraform; dot-dirs skipped). Remaining Run Profiles UI: **P4** create/edit form (#18) — **P3** header `[▶ Profile ▾]` selector shipped via PR #129.

Earlier: **#112 Phase 1 (Python LSP environment auto-wiring) shipped via PR #121** — pyright now resolves imports/types in a standard `src`-layout uv/venv project with zero per-project config. New pure `internal/lsp/pythonenv` interpreter/venv detector; the client answers pyright's `workspace/configuration` pull (was replying `-32601` to all server requests — the root cause) and advertises the capability + `didChangeConfiguration`; a Manager-owned, dialect-agnostic `WorkspaceConfigProvider` forwards `pythonPath`/`venvPath`/`analysis.extraPaths`; raw server errors are replaced by a typed setup status + non-blocking `LSPSetupCard`. Earlier shipped: **editor theme system + diagnostic tooltip (#113/#114, PR #117)** with #119 picker focus polish, **terminal PTY-exhaustion actionable error (#116)**, **file-tree / tab-bar scrollbar fixes (#118)**. Milestone 3 (Workspace Management) complete; file-tree virtualization shipped (#37/#38, PR #111). The #17 Run Profiles Execution Engine epic (#59-64) is complete; remaining Run Profiles work is the UI layer. Lazy-loading (#37 Phase 2) deferred to its own spec.

1. **Git integration follow-ups (Milestone 7 shipped via PR #162)** — deepen the just-shipped feature. **#163** hunk-level staging (PR #173, hardened #174/#176) and **#167** intent-to-add (PR #177) shipped. **#165** replaced the golem CLI shell-out with the embedded go-llm library for the AI commit message. **#169** editable diff and **#164** 3-way merge UI have since shipped and closed. Next highest value: **#166** richer branch/VCS menu, then the #164 merge backlog (#219, #220, #221, #223, #240, #241).
2. **LSP managed provisioning follow-ups** (#112 Phase 2 shipped via PR #150) — **#151 Phase 3 provisioning for `gopls`, `tsserver`, and `rust-analyzer` shipped via PR #178**; **#152** polish also shipped and closed — `configSource "override"` emission for Reset-to-auto, `RetryProvision` re-keyed to the project root for nested monorepos, and musllinux node wheels.
3. **File-tree lazy-loading follow-ups** (#37 Phase 2 shipped via PR #147) — **#149** nested `.gitignore` handling shipped via PR #192; **#148:** lazy watcher reconcile remains, benchmark-gated.
4. **Run execution identity Phase 2** (#146; follow-up to #103) — re-key single-profile output/tabs/history by `runInstanceId`: per-run retained tabs, same-profile parallelism, persisted run history, and an internal execution-plan abstraction (`executionNode`) enabling retry/resume/parallel-group later. All five #103 acceptance criteria are already met by Phase 1; this is a capability upgrade, not a fix. Complete and closed: **Phase 2A** shipped via PR #224, **2B** same-profile parallelism via PR #232, **2C** persisted history via PR #233, and **2D** owned execution plans via PR #237. The two bugs 2D surfaced are fixed in PRs #245 (#235) and #238 (#236).
5. **#142: Workspace-colored open-file tabs** — surfaced while reviewing #117: open editor tabs should always carry their owning workspace's accent (tab/font) regardless of the active workspace, so files are instantly attributable; future stretch is filtering open tabs to the active workspace. Bundle the **button-in-button DOM fix** in the editor tab bar (close `<button>` nested inside the tab `<button role="tab">` → React hydration warning) since it touches the same component.
6. **#143: File-level infra accent in the tree** — surfaced during #123 testing: infra files (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.y*ml`, `.dockerignore`, `*.tf`/`*.tfvars`) should render with the Docker (purple) / Terraform (amber) accent even when shown inside another workspace's tree, so deployment/infra files are spottable regardless of the active workspace. File-level decoration layered on the existing per-workspace tinting.

> **Bridge note:** Run Profiles grouping/filtering by view intentionally deferred to #71/#18; the Run Profiles panel behavior is unchanged across tree views.

> **Design spec ref:** Section 4 (File Tree Views)

---

### #18 / #71 Phase 1: Workspace-Owned Detection & Identity ✅ (PR #123)
Backend prerequisite for the Run Profiles UI — profiles now carry an owning workspace.
- [x] Repo-scoped `ProjectRunProfileManager`: eager multi-root detection across all workspaces → one combined list
- [x] `WorkspaceID`/`WorkspaceName`/`WorkspaceRelDir` on RunProfile; workspace-scoped deterministic detected IDs (no cross-workspace collisions; unpin invariant preserved)
- [x] Per-workspace `.firn/run-profiles.json` with v1→v2 migration (ownership stamp, ID scope, intra-file compound-step rewrite, repo-root-relative `workingDir` rebase)
- [x] Owner-routed save/pin/delete/variant; explicit owner preserved (`project` vs `root:go`); cross-workspace duplicate IDs rejected
- [x] Load resilience: atomic build-then-swap, degrade-on-corrupt-store, non-fatal migration persist, surfaced warnings
- [x] Workspace detector fixes: language markers beat infra; infra split → Docker (purple) / Terraform (amber); dot-directories skipped (no phantom `.worktrees` workspaces); duplicate workspace names disambiguated; file-explorer tree hides dot-folders (dot-files stay)

### #71: Run Profiles - Activated State, Section Reorganization, and Selection Persistence (P2) ✅ CLOSED (PR #125 panel + PR #127 follow-ups)
- [x] Activated profile working set (adopt/unadopt; persisted per workspace)

- [x] RECENT section: a just-run profile floats above Detected unless already saved/pinned
- [x] Persist activation in `.firn/run-profiles.json` v3 (definitions + adoption) and run recency in the `.firn/run-recency.json` sidecar (split in #127), both atomic temp+rename writes
- [x] Header counter with running/total counts (view-scoped)
- [x] Workspace/Project view filter & grouping (reuses tree-view toggle, single source of truth)
- [x] Workspace-accent just-ran highlight (5-min window) to distinguish the just-ran profile
- [x] **P2 review follow-ups (PR #127):** nil-`executor` guard in `StartRunProfile`; recency moved to a synchronous sidecar (no per-run profiles-file rewrite, no debounce timer); legacy-recency migration on load; `Store.PruneState` drops stale recency-only state on load while preserving adopted entries

### #18: Run Profiles - UI Integration

- [x] Resizable stdout/stderr columns (PR #138)
- [x] STDERR header glyph color (PR #138)
- [x] Sticky header bleed-through and independent lane scrolling (PR #138, refined by #137/PR #139)

### Run-output preview (shipped, PR #106)
- [x] Scrollable in-card output preview (`overflow-y: auto`, taller `max-height`)
- [x] Click/keyboard-activatable preview opens the full virtualized Output tab; selection-safe click

- [x] Refresh on file system changes

### #27: Git - Basic Operations ✅
- [x] Stage/unstage files (per-file and section select-all), commit with message
- [x] Pull/push, Publish for no-upstream, branch switching (portaled switcher)
- [x] Diff viewer (read-only side-by-side, next/prev nav, live editor-buffer diff)
- [x] Gutter change bars with peek popup: word-level inline diff + revert-to-HEAD
- [x] Actionable messaging for a `core.bare=true` repo (not "not a git repository")
- [x] Hunk-level staging in the diff viewer (#163, PR #173; hardened PR #174/#176)
- [x] Intent-to-add (`git add -N`) track-without-staging for new files (#167, PR #177)

### #164: Git - Conflict Resolution (phases 0-3 shipped)
- [x] **Phase 0 (PR #208)** — backend conflict snapshots: per-region Base/Current/Incoming data sourced from the real merge state.
- [x] **Phase 1 (PR #209)** — guarded merge-session store with close-without-write, stale-session, durable-write-before-stage, and zero-unresolved guards.
- [x] **Phase 2 (PR #213)** — CodeMirror Result-spine merge editor with Current / Incoming / Both / Manual decisions, conflict rail, keyboard navigation, undo-safe region mapping, and accessible side labels.
- [x] **Phase 3 (PR #239)** — confidence layer: exact targeted reopen (re-inserts the original marker bytes captured at session build; the header offers a jump back rather than moving the viewport), hover/focus preview of the exact resulting lines, word-level marks between the sides, provenance stripes on resolved lines, the common ancestor per region or as a lazy stage-`:1` strip, line numbers with per-card line ranges, and polite live-region announcements.
- [ ] **Phase 4** — multi-file hardening and queue auto-advance (still suppressed via `suppressQueueAdvance: true` in the UI).

Three design notes from Phase 3 worth preserving for Phase 4: store-level merge guards pair the workspace `epoch` with per-open `requestRevision`, while the component-local base-strip swap uses `requestRevision` as its prop identity; preview is deliberately DOM-only rather than a `StateEffect`, because any dispatch rebuilds the card and destroys keyboard focus; and the decorations builder declares `['doc', field]` explicitly so a future field memoization cannot silently stale the provenance stripes.

Merge follow-ups surfaced by the Phase 2 MVP: #219 key-hold preview, #220 auto-merged region hints, #221 multi-file conflict rail, #222 per-side newline metadata, #223 bulk take-Current/Incoming.

Further follow-ups surfaced by Phase 3: #240 pre-stage LSP diagnostics check (run once the buffer is marker-free, answering "does my resolution compile?" before staging), #241 base-relative word marks (diff each side against base when git recorded one, showing what each side *changed* rather than how they differ), #242 collapse conflicted-file diagnostics in the Problems panel (one actionable warning instead of one error per marker line).

Other follow-ups: #165 go-llm library shipped; #166 branch menu remains open. #169 editable diff shipped via PR #181.

## UI/UX Polish (COMPLETE)

### #35: Panel Resize & Collapse System ✅
Drag-to-resize handles between all panel junctions, collapse/expand chevrons, CSS variable-driven sizing, min-size constraints.

### #36: Icon System & Dark Background Fixes ✅
currentColor SVGs, sidebar active indicators, devicons light fills for dark backgrounds, binary file type icons.

## Performance

### #37: File Tree Virtualization & Lazy Loading ✅
- [x] **Virtualization + memoization — shipped (PR #111).** Pure `flattenVisibleTree` lowers the expanded tree into a flat `FlatRow[]` (precomputed region accent + aria level/setsize/posinset); `@tanstack/react-virtual` mounts only the visible window; `TreeRow` is `React.memo` over primitive props. The region resolver runs once per visible row instead of per node per render. Off-screen rows do not mount (5k-node tree → bounded window, asserted by a regression test). WAI-ARIA single-tab-stop keyboard nav via `aria-activedescendant`. Selected/active rows inherit their region/workspace accent (consistent Project + Workspace views).
- [x] **Lazy loading — Phase 2 shipped (PR #147).** Directory reads occur on expansion with surgical reconcile rather than full-tree reloads; watcher-registration laziness remains benchmark-gated in #148.

### #38: TreeNode Memoization ✅
Shipped in PR #111 (closed). Flattening lowers `expandedPaths` (a fresh `Set` each update) and the region resolver (a closure) into per-row primitives, so `React.memo` on the row actually holds; toggling/selecting re-renders only changed rows.

### #39: Dynamic CodeMirror Language Loading ✅ CLOSED
Shipped via PR #200. CodeMirror languages load per filename with stale-result guards and a manifest regression gate; initial static JavaScript fell from 541,248 to 399,225 gzip bytes (26.24%).

## Editor & LSP Developer Experience (NEW)

Surfaced while testing a Python workspace (`quantum_trader`) during the file-tree work (#111).

### #112: LSP - auto-provision language servers + wire project environment (COMPLETE; CLOSED)
Zero-config language support, in two layers. Provisioning implementation and review follow-ups are shipped, the 2026-07-12 packaged native closure gate passed, final fixes merged in PR #183, and #112 is closed as completed. See the [recorded smoke evidence and closure gate](#112-manual-smoke-pass-and-closure-gate).

**Phase 1 — project environment auto-wiring: SHIPPED via PR #121.** Pyright now resolves third-party (venv site-packages), first-party (`src` via `extraPaths`), and version-gated stdlib (`datetime.UTC`) imports in a standard `src`-layout uv/venv project with no per-project Firn config. New pure (no command execution) `internal/lsp/pythonenv` detector (interpreter precedence: in-root `VIRTUAL_ENV` → `.venv` → `venv` → pyenv stat-check → system; out-of-root `VIRTUAL_ENV` ignored). The client gained a server→client request handler that answers pyright's `workspace/configuration` pull (root cause: it was replying `-32601` to **all** server requests), advertises the `workspace.configuration` capability, and sends `didChangeConfiguration`. A Manager-owned, language-generic `WorkspaceConfigProvider` (dialect-agnostic across `python`/`pyright`/`basedpyright`, object + leaf sections) forwards `pythonPath`/`venvPath`/`analysis.extraPaths`. Raw server error strings replaced by typed `ServerStatus` setup fields (`setupState`: ready|missing_server|missing_interpreter|misconfigured_env|config_degraded|retryable, + action/detailCode) rendered as a non-blocking `LSPSetupCard` above the editor; `useLSPEvents` suppresses the raw Toast when typed status is present.

**Phase 2 — managed Python server provisioning: SHIPPED via PR #150.** Missing Python servers provision a pinned `basedpyright` toolchain under `~/.firn/servers`, with checksum verification, atomic installation, command-backed uv/poetry interpreter discovery, a Doctor-backed interpreter picker, and actionable offline/retry states. Provisioning is lazy to the active workspace and never mutates global PATH or project dependencies.

**Phase 3 — managed Go/TypeScript/Rust provisioning: SHIPPED via #151 / PR #178.** The family-generic provisioner now covers `gopls`, `typescript-language-server`, and `rust-analyzer` with pinned artifacts/toolchain installs, shared cache resolution, and family-aware failure guidance.

**Review polish: SHIPPED via #152; final override fixes merged in PR #183.** Manual interpreter overrides surface so **Reset to auto** is reachable; Retry preserves the nested project root; musllinux Node wheels cover Alpine's manual fallback. Override handling preserves rooted `extraPaths`, Python-version metadata, and confidence while dropping stale venv identity and superseded missing-interpreter diagnostics when necessary; reset returns to ordinary detection. Real basedpyright 1.39.9 retained only the deliberate diagnostic before and after override.

### #113: Editor - diagnostic hover tooltip has no background ✅
Shipped: the lint tooltip content (`.cm-tooltip-lint`, which renders inside the intentionally-transparent `.cm-tooltip-hover` container) now gets an opaque surface — background, border, padding, shadow, z-index — with per-severity (error/warning/info/hint) left-accent borders, all from the shared chrome design tokens.

### #114: Editor - syntax highlighting color enhancements ✅
Shipped as a **selectable syntax theme system**: `theme.ts` refactored into a pure palette registry (`palettes.ts`) + builders (`buildHighlightStyle` / `buildChrome` / `buildTheme`); 7 themes (Firn Glacier refined, Solar Flare, Tropic Coral Reef, Nebula Jewel, Ember Bifrost, Aurora Bloom, and the default Abyssal Current with its own deeper canvas), live-swapped via the editor `themeCompartment`, chosen from a StatusBar picker, and persisted globally in `localStorage`. Follow-up: per-workspace theme override (Go workspace field + regenerated bindings) and an optional darker-canvas toggle for the other themes.

## Workspace & Search UX (COMPLETE)

### #202: Hybrid Workspace Tree Rails ✅ CLOSED
Shipped via PR #211. Workspace view renders two distinct rails — active scope and per-file ownership — without changing Project view or introducing a third visual channel.

### #207: Search Result Hierarchy ✅ CLOSED
Shipped via PR #214. Result rows are anchored on the match itself, with file and directory hierarchy that stays legible when the panel is narrow.

### #215: Dimmed Syntax-Token Highlighting ✅ CLOSED
Shipped via PR #217. Match context carries real language tokens rendered at reduced emphasis, so the match remains the brightest element in the row. Lezer parses each context line standalone; token offsets merge through a single cursor pass that reconciles byte and UTF-16 indexing, and a WCAG guard keeps the dimmed palette above contrast minimums.

---

## Toolchain (COMPLETE)

### #225: Upgrade Firn from Go 1.23 to Go 1.25 ✅ SHIPPED
Shipped via PR #228 as the toolchain prerequisite for the embedded Golem consumers (#165, #226), which depend on a `go-llm` runtime that requires Go 1.25.
- [x] `go.mod` declares `go 1.25`
- [x] Every Build, Test, Lint, and Release job resolves its Go version from `go-version-file: 'go.mod'` instead of a repeated literal, so future upgrades change one line
- [x] `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and this roadmap state Go 1.25+
- [x] Historical changelog entries left unchanged
- [x] Verified with `go build`, `go vet`, `go test ./...`, `golangci-lint run ./...` (pinned v2.11.4, built with go1.26.1), and the frontend suite/build/lint/format gates
- [x] No generated Wails binding changes

Out of scope: adopting `go-llm` itself (#165/#226) and unrelated dependency bumps.

## Dependency Upgrades (COMPLETE)

### #40: Upgrade TypeScript, Vite & Test Tooling ✅
TypeScript 5.7+, Vite 6.x, @swc/jest, path aliases, optimizeDeps.

---

## Code Quality

### #41: Split Zustand Store into Domain Slices
Re-scope against the current architecture: Git, LSP, search, commands, and merge sessions already have dedicated seams. Do not schedule a standalone decomposition. Preserve the existing selector/action API and extract only the run domain if #146 proves that a focused extraction materially reduces its implementation.

### #42: Fix Hardcoded macOS Paths ✅ CLOSED
Closed as completed on 2026-07-11. Production paths use `os.UserHomeDir`, `filepath`, platform-specific implementations, and cross-platform release builds rather than hard-coded macOS locations.

---

## Accessibility

### #43: Accessibility Improvements (WCAG AA) ✅ CLOSED
Shipped via PR #201. Bypass navigation, contrast corrections, APG keyboard/focus behavior, terminal focus restoration, ID-reference semantics, numeric WCAG guards, and interaction regressions are covered. A human VoiceOver/NVDA and 200% visual pass remains prudent release validation, not open implementation scope.

---

## Future Features

### #44: Command Palette ✅ IMPLEMENTED (PR #206; TRACKER OPEN)
Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P opens a native-dialog palette backed by the shared late-bound command registry, deterministic fuzzy matching, keyboard navigation, and shortcut display. The implementation is merged; the GitHub issue needs closure housekeeping.

### #45: Context Menus
Right-click menus for file explorer (new/rename/delete/copy path) and editor tabs (close/close others).

### #46: Breadcrumb Navigation
Clickable file path breadcrumbs above editor with sibling dropdown navigation.

### #226: Golem - Read-Only Workspace Chat Panel — SHIPPED
Shipped via PR #262 (squashed to develop `e56b28e`). The first AI surface: a consent-gated, read-only chat panel scoped to the active workspace, on the embedded `go-llm` runtime from #165. Assistant replies settle to sanitized Markdown once their run finishes, tool activity groups into expandable operation detail, and a per-run 128 KiB assistant-output cap stops a runaway model — the run fails rather than truncating, because Golem skips its thread save on a sink error and a manufactured success would persist a suffix the user never saw.

Follow-ups: #263 settings UI, #264 durable multi-conversation, #265 token/context usage (blocked on go-llm usage emission).

### AI Chat Panel (v1.5)
Claude integration with context-aware code assistance, diff preview, provider architecture.

### gRPC Service Integration (v2.0+)
Service Adapter Pattern for connecting to external backends.

## Bug Fixes

### #33: Window Dragging Not Working ✅ CLOSED
Fixed via Wails macOS titlebar configuration and `--wails-draggable: drag` on the header.

### #34: Add Button Type Attributes ✅ CLOSED
Closed via PR #190 on 2026-07-13. All production buttons declare explicit literal `type` attributes, and a TypeScript AST regression test enforces valid literal values while guarding against a vacuous directory scan.

### Editor navigation scroll ✅ FIXED (PRs #216, #218)
Navigating to a line failed to scroll in two distinct cases: a file opened fresh by the navigation itself, and an already-open tab sitting in the background. Both now scroll the target line into view.

### Run-profile card action row clipped ✅ FIXED (PR #227)
The adopt button was clipped at narrow card widths; the action row now wraps.
