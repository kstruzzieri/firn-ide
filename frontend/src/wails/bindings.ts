/**
 * The one deliberate exception to this adapter's "direct re-exports only" rule.
 *
 * WHY: every object-returning Golem binding in bindings/firn/app.ts pipes its
 * result through a generated `createFrom` before handing it back, and that
 * transformation is LOSSY in exactly the two ways the Golem wire contract
 * cares about. The generated constructors DEFAULT a missing required field
 * (`if (!("readOnly" in $$source)) this["readOnly"] = false;`), and the pinned
 * runtime's `$Create.Array` / `$Create.Map` rewrite a null collection to `[]` /
 * `{}`. A malformed payload therefore arrives indistinguishable from a valid
 * one — worst case, a settings document with no `readOnly` key materialises as
 * an EDITABLE surface, and `readOnly` is a fail-closed UI control. So these
 * nine calls are read raw and the wire payload reaches the validators
 * untouched.
 *
 * IDS: mirrored from the generated bindings, not invented here.
 * src/__tests__/wails/golemRawCalls.test.ts pins every entry against the
 * `$Call.ByID(...)` literal inside the matching generated function, and fails
 * when a regeneration renumbers one, a rename moves one, or a NEW
 * object-returning Golem call appears that is not routed raw. ByID rather than
 * ByName because this repo ships obfuscated builds (build/Taskfile.yml), where
 * reflection-visible method names are gone but the numeric ids are stable.
 *
 * CONSUMERS: the results are typed `unknown` on purpose. The `parse*`
 * validators in src/types/golem.ts and src/types/golemConfig.ts — all of which
 * take `unknown` — are the only things that may read them.
