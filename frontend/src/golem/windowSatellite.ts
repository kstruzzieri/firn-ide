/**
 * The undocked window's relay client (#271 spec §5.2).
 *
 * It owns the whole satellite lifecycle: subscribe, bootstrap, install main's
 * draft map, report `ready`, dispatch acknowledged actions, and run the re-dock
 * transfer. Nothing here executes a turn — every mutation is a `GolemViewAction`
 * that main admits or refuses, and this window believes only what it is told.
 *
 * Three orderings drive the shape of this file:
 *
 * 1. **Go emits before it answers.** `BootstrapGolemWindow` publishes the
 *    `bootstrapped` snapshot — and main starts relaying — before the bound
 *    call's own response reaches JS. So both subscriptions are registered first
 *    and everything that arrives in the gap is buffered, never dropped.
 * 2. **React StrictMode starts twice.** Per-start state lives in an `Owner`,
 *    only one of which is `active`; a retired owner's late bootstrap can neither
 *    replace the live core nor write to the store.
 * 3. **A re-dock can land mid-Send.** The draft map is read through a getter
 *    *inside* the handoff barrier, after the outstanding action drained and its
 *    host clearing ran, so an already-submitted prompt is not handed back to the
 *    composer.
