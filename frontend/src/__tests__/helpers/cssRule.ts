/**
 * Extracts the body of the first `selector { ... }` block in a stylesheet.
 *
 * jsdom resolves no CSS from a module, so stylesheet guards read the file and
 * assert on declarations directly. Comments are stripped first: a comment can
 * carry the very text an assertion looks for, and a `}` inside one would
 * truncate the body. `{` must follow the selector directly, so `.dialog`
 * cannot bind to `.dialogTitle` or `.dialog::backdrop`; the selector must
 * also start a line, so it cannot bind inside a complex selector such as
 * `.root .dialog`.
 *
 * Ceiling: `[^}]*` also stops at a `}` inside a string or url(); only the
 * first block for the selector is returned, so a later block for the same
 * selector would win the cascade unseen; and a rule nested inside an at-rule
 * (indented) is not seen at all.
